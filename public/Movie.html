<h1>The Best Movies According to Ellis</h1>
<h2>My Top 5 Movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>This is Tolkiens classic work interpreted into Peter Jacksons movie.</p>
<h3>The Hobbit</h3>
<p>The prequel to Lord of the Rings, a visual feast.</p>
<h3>Forest Gump</h3>
<p>A tale of innocence, which question are perception of intelligence.</p>
<h3>Schindlers List</h3>
<p>A harrowing Holocaust tale that glimpses the darkness of the human soul that thrives today.</p>
<h3>Going Postal</h3>
<p>Terry pratchett's book interpreted as a movie, with all of his comedic adroit perspective of human behaviour.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Rumi The Guest House.</h3>

<p>
This being human is a guest house.<br />
Every morning a new arrival.<br /></p>

<p>A joy, a depression, a meanness,<br />
some momentary awareness comes<br />
as an unexpected visitor.<br /></p>

<p>Welcome and entertain them all!<br />
Even if theyâ€™re a crowd of sorrows,<br />
who violently sweep your house<br />
empty of its furniture,<br />
still, treat each guest honorably.<br />
He may be clearing you out<br />
for some new delight.<br /></p>

<p>The dark thought, the shame, the malice,<br />
meet them at the door laughing,<br />
and invite them in.<br /></p>

<p>Be grateful for whoever comes,<br />
because each has been sent<br />
as a guide from beyond.<br />
</p>
